# Recursive Menu Program

This project is a menu-based Python program that showcases the power of recursion through interactive examples. It was created as part of my **Cognizant externship** to demonstrate practical applications of recursive thinking and functional programming.

## Features

- Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion  
- Find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion  
- Draw a recursive fractal tree using the turtle module (bonus)  
- User-friendly menu with clear prompts and input validation  
- Well-commented code structure for easy understanding  

## Example Output

Welcome to the Recursive Artistry Program!  
Choose an option:  
1. Calculate Factorial  
2. Find Fibonacci  
3. Draw a Recursive Fractal  
4. Exit  

> 1  
Enter a number to find its factorial: 5  
The factorial of 5 is 120.

> 2  
Enter the position of the Fibonacci number: 7  
The 7th Fibonacci number is 13.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then in your terminal or command prompt:

python recursive_menu_program.py or python3 recursive_menu_program.py

If you choose the fractal drawing option, a Turtle graphics window will open. Close the window to return to the menu.
